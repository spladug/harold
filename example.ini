; Harold is split up into various "plugins".  By default, no plugins will be
; started and Harold won't do much of anything.  To activate a plugin, create a
; section for it in your configuration as below.
;
; Some plugins can also "provide" another plugin's interface. This allows for
; multiple implementations / backends for the same feature set.


; Implements an HTTP server for other plugins to use.  It does not do anything
; itself.
;
; required plugins: none
[harold:plugin:http]
; what endpoint http server should listen on for incoming connections
; see: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/14.0.0/core/howto/endpoints.html#servers
endpoint = tcp:port=8011
; a secret token used to authenticate requests made to harold
hmac_secret = asupersecrettoken
; how the outside world can find harold
public_root = https://harold.reddit.local/


; An IRC client that can be used by other plugins.
;
; required plugins: none
; provides: irc
;[harold:plugin:irc]
; harold will authenticate with userserv if this is present
;username = username
; nick to display as in channels
;nick = harold
; where to connect and how to authenticate
;host = irc.example.org
;port = 7000
;use_ssl = true
;password = hijklmnop
; if provided, harold will authenticate with userserv as `username` with this passowrd
;userserv_password = abcdefg
; additional channels to join upon connection. useful for messaging from HTTP API.
;channels = #channel,#otherchannel

;
; required plugins: none
; provides: irc
[harold:plugin:slack]

;
; Note: harold has so far only been tested with sqlite.
